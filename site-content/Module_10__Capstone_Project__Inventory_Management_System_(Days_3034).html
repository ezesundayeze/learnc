        <h1>Module 10: Capstone Project - Inventory Management System (Days 30-34)</h1>

<h2>1. Philosophy Focus: Spaced Repetition &amp; Inductive Teaching</h2>

<p>This is it. This final project is a comprehensive review of the entire
course, designed to make the patterns you've learned second nature. You
will be building a complete program from the ground up, applying your
knowledge of structs, dynamic arrays, multi-file projects, and file I/O.
We will guide the structure, but you will discover the implementation
details on your own, solidifying your fluency in C.</p>

<h3><strong>DAY 30: Project Planning and Design</strong></h3>

<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Design the data structures and plan the program architecture
before writing any code. A good plan is the most important part of a
successful project.</p>

<p>1. The Project Brief</p>

<p>We will build a command-line inventory management system for a small
store. The program must be able to:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Add a new product to the inventory (with a unique ID, name, price,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>and quantity).</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Display a list of all products.</p></li>
<li><p>Update the quantity of an existing product.</p></li>
<li><p>Search for a product by its name.</p></li>
<li><p>Save the inventory to a file.</p></li>
<li><p>Load the inventory from a file when the program starts.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>2. Designing the Data Structure (product.h)</p>

<p>What information do we need for each product?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A unique identifier (an integer is fine).</p></li>
<li><p>A name (a string).</p></li>
<li><p>A price (a floating-point number, like double).</p></li>
<li><p>A quantity in stock (an integer).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Based on this, define the Product struct in a new file, product.h.
Don't forget your header guard!</p>

<p>3. Planning the Functions (product.h and product.c)</p>

<p>What actions will we need to perform? Think about the project brief and
translate it into function prototypes. Add these to product.h and create
empty implementations in a new product.c file.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>void add_product(...): Will need to take the list, counts, and the</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>new product's info.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>void print_inventory(...): Will need the list and the count.</p></li>
<li><p>Product* find<em>product</em>by_name(...): A function that searches the</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>list for a product by its name and returns a <em>pointer</em> to it if
  found, or NULL if not found. This is a very common and powerful
  pattern.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>void save_inventory(...): Similar to the to-do list.</p></li>
<li><p>void load_inventory(...): Also similar to the to-do list.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>4. Planning the Main Loop (main.c)</p>

<p>In a new main.c file, sketch out the main function's logic.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It will need variables for the dynamic array (Product *inventory),</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>count, and capacity.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>It will need to call load_inventory at the start.</p></li>
<li><p>It will have a while loop with a switch statement for the user menu</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(Add, List, Update, Search, Exit).</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>It will call save_inventory at the end.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>By the end of today, you should have three files (main.c, product.h,
product.c) that are mostly empty but contain the complete "skeleton"
of your application.</p>

<h3><strong>DAY 31-32: Core Logic and UI Implementation</strong></h3>

<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Flesh out the skeleton you designed, building the core
functionality of the application.</p>

<p>1. Implement Core Functions</p>

<p>Work through the empty functions in product.c and write the code for
them.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>add<em>product</strong>: This will be very similar to your add</em>task</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>function. It must check the capacity and realloc the inventory
  array if it's full before adding the new product.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p><strong>print_inventory</strong>: This should be straightforward. Loop through</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the array and print the details of each product in a nicely
  formatted table.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p><strong>find<em>product</em>by_name</strong>: Loop through the inventory. Use strcmp()</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(from <string.h>) to compare the name of each product with the
  target name. If you find a match, return the address of that
  Product struct in the array (&amp;inventory[i]). If the loop
  finishes without a match, return NULL.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>

<p>2. Implement the Main Loop</p>

<p>In main.c, write the code for your user menu.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>For "Add", prompt the user for the name, price, and quantity. Then</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>call add_product.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>For "List", call print_inventory.</p></li>
<li><p>For "Update", first ask the user for the name of the product to</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>update. Call find<em>product</em>by_name.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p>If the function returns NULL, print "Product not found."</p></li>
<li><p>If it returns a valid pointer, ask the user for the new quantity</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>and update it directly through the pointer (e.g.,
  found<em>product->quantity = new</em>quantity;).</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Leave "Search" and "Exit" for now.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>3. Compile and Test Incrementally</p>

<p>As you complete each function, compile your code (gcc main.c product.c
-o inventory) and test it thoroughly. Don't wait until everything is
written to compile for the first time. Testing as you go makes debugging
much easier.</p>

<pre><code>gcc main.c product.c -o inventory
</code></pre>

<h3><strong>DAY 33: Persistence and Advanced Features</strong></h3>

<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Make the inventory persistent and implement the search
functionality.</p>

<p>1. Implement save<em>inventory and load</em>inventory</p>

<p>This is a direct application of the skills you learned in Module 9.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>save_inventory</strong>: Open the specified file in "w" mode. Loop</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>through the products and use fprintf to save them in a CSV format
  (e.g., id,price,quantity,name\n). Be careful with the product
  name, as it's a string.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p><strong>load_inventory</strong>: Open the file in "r" mode. Read line-by-line</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>with fgets. Parse each line using sscanf (remember the %[^
  ]
  trick for the name). For each parsed product, call your existing
  add_product function to add it to the dynamic array.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Integrate these calls into the start and end of your main function.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>2. Implement Search</p>

<p>In your main.c switch statement:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>For the "Search" case, prompt the user for a product name.</p></li>
<li><p>Call find<em>product</em>by_name.</p></li>
<li><p>If it returns a pointer, print the details of the found product.</p></li>
<li><p>If it returns NULL, print "Product not found."</p></li>
</ul>

<p>3. Final Testing</p>

<p>Your application should now be fully functional. Test all features:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Add several products. Exit the program.</p></li>
<li><p>Run it again. Does it load the products correctly?</p></li>
<li><p>Update a quantity. Save and reload. Is the new quantity still there?</p></li>
<li><p>Search for a product that exists and one that doesn't.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>DAY 34: Course Wrap-up and The Path Forward</strong></h3>

<p><strong>Congratulations!</strong> You have completed this course and built a serious,
non-trivial C application. You've journeyed from printf("Hello,
World!"); to manual memory management, multi-file projects, and
persistent data storage. You should feel proud of what you've
accomplished. C is a language that rewards a deep understanding of the
machine, and you now have a solid foundation in it.</p>

<p><strong>Reflecting on the Philosophy:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Spaced Repetition:</strong> You didn't just learn realloc once; you used</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>it in the to-do list and again in the inventory manager. Each core
  concept was revisited multiple times in new contexts.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p><strong>Knowledge-graph-based learning:</strong> Each module built directly on</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the last. You couldn't have understood dynamic arrays without
  pointers, and you couldn't have built a multi-file project
  without first understanding functions.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p><strong>Inductive teaching:</strong> We provided the goals ("build a persistent</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>to-do list") but you discovered the exact implementation,
  debugging your own code and learning the patterns far more deeply
  than if you had just been told them.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p><strong>Interleaved instruction:</strong> You learned a little bit about</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>pointers, then strings, then structs, then came back to use them
  all together with dynamic memory. This is how deep retention is
  built.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>

<p>What's Next?</p>

<p>Your journey as a programmer is just beginning. C is a gateway to
understanding almost every other area of computer science. Here are some
paths you can explore from here:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Data Structures and Algorithms:</strong> You've built a dynamic array (a</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>vector). Now learn to build Linked Lists, Hash Tables, Trees, and
  Graphs in C. This is the fundamental basis of all advanced
  software engineering.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p><strong>Systems Programming:</strong> Explore how operating systems work. Learn</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>about processes, threads, sockets for networking, and interacting
  with the OS at a lower level. The book "The C Programming
  Language" (K&amp;R) is the timeless classic for this.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p><strong>Embedded Systems:</strong> C is the king of programming for</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>microcontrollers (like Arduinos) and other hardware. If you enjoy
  making things in the physical world light up and move, this is a
  fascinating field.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p><strong>Contribute to Open Source:</strong> Many of the world's most important</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>software projects are written in C (Linux Kernel, Git, SQLite).
  Find a project you admire, study its code, and try to fix a small
  bug. It's the fastest way to learn from experts.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p><strong>Revisit Rust:</strong> Now that you deeply understand manual memory</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>management, go back and look at Rust. You will have a profound new
  appreciation for the safety guarantees provided by the borrow
  checker and the concept of ownership. You'll see <em>why</em> Rust was
  designed the way it was.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ol>

<p>Thank you for taking this journey. Keep coding, stay curious, and build
amazing things.</p>
